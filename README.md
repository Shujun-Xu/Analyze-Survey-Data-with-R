### Purpose of the Study
* To evaluate the protective effect of Physical Recreation Activities (PRA) on total diabetes (including diagnosed and undiagnosed) adjusting for possible confounders , and meanwhile examine the effect modification of race/ethnicity on PRA and diabetes outcome.

### Background
* During 1999‚Äì2016,the age-adjusted prevalence of total diabetes significantly increased among adults aged 18 years or older.
* Physical activity has long been recognized as playing a role in the prevention of type 2 diabetes (T2D) and previous meta-analyses revealed this protection effect can be modified by race/ethnicity.

### Data Source
* Observational,Cross-sectional data collected from National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 2017-2018 ; 5852 U.S. adults ( age 18 or older) with self-reported diabetes outcome or HbA1c (Glycohemoglobin) testing result on record included in the analysis. 
* Nationall Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) is designed to assess the health and nutritional status of adults and children in the United States. It is a unique survey combing interviews and physical examinations, and the data set is divided into multiple files that need to be merged. Since the survey is meant to be representative of the entire population, the sample should be appropriately weighted using the weight variables provided in the data set.

### Statistical Analysis
* Summary of univariate distribution of all variables
* Bivariate analysis (Chi-squared tests)
* Multi-variate analysis (Ordinary Logistic Regression Model, stepwise variable selection , ùõº = 0.05)
* Software: R-Studio version 3.6.2
